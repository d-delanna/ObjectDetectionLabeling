# ObjectDetectionLabeling
[Internal Use Python 3.10] Auto-clicker for Object Detection dataset labeling.

To avoid making people hassel with API authorization and authentication, I had to make this program a little scuffed.
To use this, you will need to DOWNLOAD the contents of the GoogleSheet into a Microsoft Spreadsheet. 
Then you will need to input the path of your downloaded file into the program for it to run.
Once you are done, you will have to upload the contents of the Microsopft Spreadsheet back to the Google Drive.

This program is listening for keyboard inputs the entire time it is running, so you must exit whenever you are not labeling data. 
It is easiest if you open a new window before starting.
Once it is running, you should not need to click anything. Simply pressing the arrow keys will input your answer into the dataset, change to the next picture, and save your spreadsheet for you when you exit.
